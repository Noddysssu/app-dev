>> "*This is not a love story*" is the opening line of the movie 500 Days of Summer. It's also probably the most objective, honest summary of the movie. The audience hesitated to know what category to put this movie in, it was clearly not a Romantic Comedy, not an Adventure movie, titled Romance. To be precise, the film is an emotional adventure between two people.  They met, played, and parted. The title of the movie 500 days - a definite number, foretold the end of this separation. That ending can be said to be separation, separation, but certainly not parting, because the love has never been started. This is not a romance movie, this is a coming-of-age movie, a movie about Tom becoming a man, who at first didn't dare to proactively say how much he liked the girl when At the beginning of the movie, a selfish person who only thinks about himself and changed for the better when Tom invited Autumn to coffee at the end of the movie without hesitation.
